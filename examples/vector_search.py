"""
This example shows how to use some of the Coherence AI features to store
vectors and perform a k-nearest neighbors (k-nn) search on those vectors to
find matches for search text.

Coherence includes an implementation of the HNSW index which can be used to
index vectors to improve search times.

Coherence is only a vector store so in order to actually create vectors from
text snippets this example uses the `sentence-transformers` package to
integrate with a model and produce vector embeddings from text.

This example has shows how easy it is to add vector search capabilities to
cache data in Coherence and how to easily add HNSW indexes to those searches.
It has not been optimised at all for speed of loading vector data or searches.

Coherence Vectors
=================

Coherence Python client can handle a few different types of vector,
this example will use the FloatVector type.

Just like any other data type in Coherence, vectors are stored in normal
Coherence caches. The vector may be stored as the actual cache value,
or it may be in a field of another type that is the cache value. Vector data
is then loaded into Coherence the same way that any other data is loaded
using the NamedMap API.

Movie Database
==============

This example is going to build a small database of movies. The database is
small because the data used is stored in the source repository along with the
code. The same techniques could be used to load any of the freely available
much larger JSON datasets with the required field names.

The Data Model
==============

This example is not going to use an specialized classes to store the data in
the cache. The dataset is a json file and the example will use Coherence json
support to read and store the data.

The schema of the JSON movie data looks like this:

+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Field Name	     |    Description                                        |
+====================+=======================================================+
| title              + The title of the movie                                |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| plot               | A short summary of the plot of the movie              |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| fullplot           | A longer summary of the plot of the movie             |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| cast               + A list of the names of the actors in the movie        |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| genres             | A list of string values representing the different    |
|                    | genres the movie belongs to                           |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| runtime            | How long the move runs for in minutes                 |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| poster             | A link to the poster for the movie                    |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| languages          | A list of string values representing the different    |
|                    | languages for the movie                               |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| directors          | A list of the names of the directors of the movie     |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| writers            | A list of the names of the writers of the movie       |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

This example uses the fullplot to create the vector embeddings for each
movie. Other fields can be used by normal Coherence filters to further narrow
down vector searches.

Searching Vectors
=================

A common way to search data in Coherence caches is to use Coherence
aggregators. The aggregator feature has been used to implement k-nearest
neighbour (k-nn) vector searching using a new built-in aggregator named
SimilaritySearch. When invoking a SimilaritySearch aggregator on a cache
the results are returned as a list of QueryResult instances.

The SimilaritySearch aggregator is used to perform a Knn vector search on a
cache in the same way that normal Coherence aggregators are used.

HNSW Indexing
=============

Coherence includes an implementation of the HNSW index that can be used to
speed up searches. The hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) algorithm is
a graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search technique.

An index is added to a cache in Coherence by calling the add_index method on
the cache. In this example, a HNSWIndex is created with a ValueExtractor that
will extract the vector field from the cache value and an int parameter that
specifies the number of dimensions the vector has.
