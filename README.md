The Coherence Python Client allows Python applications to act as cache clients to an Oracle Coherence cluster using gRPC as the network transport.

#### Features
* Familiar Map-like interface for manipulating cache entries including but not limited to:
    * `put`, `put_if_absent`, `put_all`, `get`, `get_all`, `remove`, `clear`, `get_or_default`, `replace`, `replace_mapping`, `size`, `is_empty`, `contains_key`, `contains_value`
* Cluster-side querying, aggregation and filtering of map entries
* Cluster-side manipulation of map entries using EntryProcessors
* Registration of listeners to be notified of:
    * mutations such as insert, update and delete on Maps
    * map lifecycle events such as truncated, released or destroyed
    * session lifecycle events such as connected, disconnected, reconnected and closed
* Support for storing Python objects as JSON as well as the ability to serialize to Java objects on the server for access from other Coherence language API's

#### Requirements
* [Coherence CE](https://github.com/oracle/coherence) 22.06.4+ or Coherence 14.1.1.2206.4+ Commercial edition with a configured [gRPCProxy](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.2206/develop-remote-clients/using-coherence-grpc-server.html).
* Python 3.11.x


#### Starting a Coherence Cluster

Before testing the Python client, you must ensure a Coherence cluster is available.
For local development, we recommend using the Coherence CE Docker image; it contains
everything necessary for the client to operate correctly.

```bash
docker run -d -p 1408:1408 ghcr.io/oracle/coherence-ce:22.06.5
```

## Installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install coherence-client
```

## Documentation

[https://oracle.github.io/coherence-py-client/](https://oracle.github.io/coherence-py-client/)

## Examples

The following example connects to a Coherence cluster running gRPC Proxy on default
port of 1408, creates a new `NamedCache` with key `str` and value of a `str|int` and
issues `put()`, `get()`, `size()` and `remove` operations.

```python
from coherence import NamedCache, Session
import asyncio


async def run_test():

    # create a new Session to the Coherence server
    session: Session = await Session.create()

    # create a new NamedCache with key of string|int and value of string|int
    cache: NamedCache[str, str|int] = await session.get_cache("test")

    # put a new key/value
    k: str = "one"
    v: str = "only-one"
    await cache.put(k, v)

    # get the value for a key in the cache
    r = await cache.get(k)

    # print the value got for a key in the cache
    print("The value of key \"one\" is " + r)

    k1: str = "two"
    v1: int = 2
    await cache.put(k1, v1)
    r = await cache.get(k1)
    print("The value of key \"two\" is " + str(r))

    # print the size of the cache
    print("Size of the cache test is " + str(await cache.size()))

    # remove an entry from the cache
    await cache.remove(k1)


# run the test
asyncio.run(run_test())
```
